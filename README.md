# RydeBot :oncoming_automobile:
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zedtang/RydeBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zedtang/RydeBot)


## Project Vision  
We want to build a simple Rideshare App called RydeBot. Users will be able to login and either post as a rider, or select the posts as a driver.   
Riders can post their requests which are shown to drivers. Drivers can view the riders locations/request schedule and select the rider they would like to pick up. They can also chat with riders. Once selected, navigation is started on their phone.

## Tentative Timeline
Week 5/6-5/12: finish gui, set up parse server, finish login/signup activity, start on post and browser activity  
Week 5/13-5/19: finish post and browser activity, start on chat activity  
Week 5/20-5/26: finish chat activity, finish rider/driver activity  
Week 5/27-6/2: TBD  
Week 6/3-6/9: TBD
